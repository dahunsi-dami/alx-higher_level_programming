2. Elements of list of list division module
===========================

How to use ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)``
--------------------------

Import module and the function in the module:
>>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided

Create matrix with two lists in a list:
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

Divide all elements of matrix by zero:
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Check for when None is passed for matrix:
>>> matrix_divided(None, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Check for when no div is passed:
>>> matrix_divided(matrix)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix_divided() missing 1 required positional argument: 'div'

Check for when float is passed as div:
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2.5)
[[0.4, 0.8, 1.2], [1.6, 2.0, 2.4]]

Make matrix of list of tuples:
>>> matrix = [[1, 2] [3, 4]]
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not tuple

Make matrix of list of lists with uneven length:
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]]

Pass matrix with list of lists of uneven length:
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Create a matrix with element that's not a float or integer:
>>> matrix = [["1", 2], [3, 4]]

Pass matrix with element that's not integer or float to function:
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Pass string to matrix_divided function:
>>> matrix_divided("string", "string")
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Check if matrix is a str & div is an integer:
>>> matrix_divided("string", 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Check if matrix is a matrix & div is a string:
>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2], [3, 4]], "string")
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: div must be a number
